# v0.4 Priority Queue

This is the active short-form developer queue for the v0.4 era.

At the start of v0.4 planning, there is no active implementation queue yet.

## Active order

- No active v0.4 items are scheduled yet.

## Activation rule

- Add an item here only after it has been justified and scoped in the v0.4
  planning process.
- Each new item should be listed in the intended execution order.

## Boundary

- v0.3 is complete and closed out in `docs/v03-closeout-and-followups.md`.
- This queue should not inherit old work automatically; new entries must be
  explicitly chosen.
